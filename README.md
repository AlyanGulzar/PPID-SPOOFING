#  PPID Spoofing (Process Injection Simulation)

This project demonstrates **Parent Process ID (PPID) Spoofing** on Windows, a common **malware defense evasion technique**.  
It was developed as part of an academic project on **Operating System Security and Malware Simulation**.

## üìñ What is PPID Spoofing?
Attackers use PPID Spoofing to make a malicious process appear as if it was spawned by a **legitimate parent process** such as `explorer.exe` or `winlogon.exe`.  
This tricks security tools, bypasses naive detection methods, and helps malware blend into normal system activity.

### Example:
- Instead of showing `mamal.exe` launched directly, the malware appears to be a child of `explorer.exe`.  
- This hides it from **basic process ancestry checks** and some EDR solutions.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
- Uses the **Windows API** function `CreateProcessW` with the flag `PROC_THREAD_ATTRIBUTE_PARENT_PROCESS`.
- Spoofs the parent process handle (e.g., `explorer.exe` PID).
- Launches the payload (`mamal.exe`) under the spoofed parent process.
- Tested on Windows with **Python 3**, `pywin32`, and `psutil`.

## üöÄ Usage

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer**: This code is for **educational and research purposes only**.  
> Do **NOT** use it on systems without explicit permission. Misuse may violate laws.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AlyanGulzar/PPID-SPOOFING.git
   cd PPID-SPOOFING
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install psutil pywin32
3. Run the script
   ```bash
   python Spoof.py
4. The script:
   ‚Ä¢ Locates a trusted process (explorer.exe, winlogon.exe, or services.exe).
   ‚Ä¢ Creates a new process (mamal.exe by default) with a spoofed parent PID.
   ‚Ä¢ Verify via Task Manager or Process Explorer ‚Üí The new process will appear as if launched by the trusted parent.

## üîç Detection & Defense

- Monitor `PROC_THREAD_ATTRIBUTE_PARENT_PROCESS` calls.  
- Alert if `explorer.exe` spawns unusual children.  
- Hunt for **PPID and binary path mismatches**.  
- Apply **EDR/SIEM rules** and process integrity checks.
